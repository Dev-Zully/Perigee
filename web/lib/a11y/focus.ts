 * Focus-management primitives — issue #703.

 * in the error dialog never filtered out hidden controls, and the copy in the
 * wizard never handled the empty case, so each one is correct only by
 * accident.
 *
 * Everything here is deliberately DOM-free. The functions take a structural
 * type, so the decision logic ("is this tabbable", "where does Tab go next")
 * can be tested without jsdom, and the hook in `hooks/useFocusTrap.ts` is
 * left with nothing but wiring.
