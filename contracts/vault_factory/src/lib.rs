//! # Perigee Vault Factory — deterministic clone deployment and upgrades
//!
//! Two closely-related deployment concerns live in this crate:
//!
//! - **#632 — clone factory.** [`VaultFactory::create_vault`] deploys a
//!   [`VaultProxy`] per vault at a **deterministic address**, derived from a
//!   caller-supplied seed, so a vault's address can be known before it exists
//!   and recomputed by anyone.
//! - **#635 — upgradeability.** [`VaultProxy`] is a UUPS-style proxy: the
//!   implementation pointer lives in the proxy's own storage and is changed by
//!   [`VaultProxy::upgrade_to`], gated on a named upgrader and expected to match
//!   the caller's own view of the current implementation. Previous
//!   implementations are retained so [`VaultProxy::rollback_to`] can revert
//!   inside a bounded window.
//!
//! ## What EIP-1167 does and does not transfer to Soroban
//!
//! EIP-1167 is a 45-byte minimal proxy: the point is **one deployed artifact,
//! many instances, cheap per-instance creation**. Soroban has no EVM bytecode to
//! embed, so the literal technique does not port. Two of the three properties do,
//! and this implementation gets both of them by different means:
//!
//! | EIP-1167 property | How it is achieved here |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | One artifact, many instances | Every vault is a [`VaultProxy`] running the same tiny WASM; no per-vault custom code exists. |
//! | Cheap creation | The proxy stores four values and never deploys anything. |
//! | Deterministic address (EIP-1167 + CREATE2) | `env.deployer().with_current_contract(salt).deploy_v2(..)`, with `salt = sha256(owner, seed)`. |
//!
//! What does **not** port is transparent call delegation. An EVM minimal proxy
//! forwards *every* call; a Soroban proxy cannot, because the host resolves the
//! target contract from the invocation. So a [`VaultProxy`] exposes its own
//! explicit methods rather than proxying an implementation's method set. The
//! upgrade pointer therefore governs the **vault configuration the proxy
//! consults**, not the bytecode executing the call — and the proxy's own WASM is
//! fixed for the life of the instance.
//!
//! That is a real difference and it is why [`VaultProxy`] is small: it holds the
//! upgrade-relevant state and nothing else, and an upgraded implementation reads
//! that state through [`VaultProxy::implementation`].
//!
//! ## Storage gap
//!
//! [`STORAGE_GAP_SLOTS`] instance-storage slots are reserved in the
//! [`ProxyConfig`] layout — the key-slot analogue of an EVM `uint256[N] __gap`.
//! The reservation is **layout-only**: no ledger entry is written for a gap slot,
//! so it costs no rent, but a future version can claim `ProxyConfig` fields in the
//! reserved region without moving the existing ones, which is what keeps a layout
//! change from reinterpreting live entries.
